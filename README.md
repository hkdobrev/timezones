# Timezone project

### by [Haralan Dobrev][hkdobrev.com] for [Toptal][] screening process.


Project task:

Write an application that shows time in different timezones.

- User must be able to create an account and log in
- When logged in, user can see timezones he entered
- When entered, each entry has a Name, Name of city in timezone, difference to GMT time
- When displayed, each entry has also current time
- Filter by names
- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication.
- All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this)
- In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
- Bonus: unit tests!
- You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
